## Well Test Analysis of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs
Given the following presssure drawdown and data, methods are presented for matching observed pressure data during drawdown or buildup tests. The methods, illustrated with step-by-step examples, allow calculation of fracture transmissivity, storage capacity coefficient, skin, size of matrix blocks, fracture porosity, fracture storage, and radius of investigation.
