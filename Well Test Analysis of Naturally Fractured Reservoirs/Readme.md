## Well Test Analysis of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs
Methods are presented for matching observed pressure data during drawdown or buildup tests. The methods, illustrated with 
step-by-step examples, allow calculation of fracture transmissivity, storage capacity coefficient, skin, size of matrix blocks, fracture porosity, 
fracture storage, and radius of investigation.
