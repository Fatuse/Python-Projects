## Borai's Best fit correlation curve
The importance of having a correct value of the porosity exponent m in petrophysical interpretation of NFRs is never over-emphasized. That can easily make the difference between abandoning or completing a successful well as proved dramatically in many places around the world. There is a tendency in many quarters to assume a constant value of m (a typical case is the assumption m = 2). This might be a reasonable assumption in the case of some conventional interparticle single-porosity reservoirs; but it is generally a poor assumption in NFRs. In the case of NFRs represented by dual porosity models there are three different values of the porosity exponent: mb of the matrix block, mf of the natural fractures and m of the composite system of matrix and fractures. For dual porosity models made out of matrix and fractures: mb > m > mf.

In general, as porosity of the composite system gets smaller, the value of m also gets smaller. This is illustrated in the graph with data of carbonates from 14 Abu Dhabi fields covering an area of approximately 10,000 km2 (Borai, 1987). Borai's best fit correlation is fine, but a better approach involves using a dual porosity model as it allows quantifying properties of the NFR. An example of such a dual porosity model, for the case in which mb = 2.2 and mf=1, is presented in the final graph as a crossplot of m vs. matrix porosity ϕ2 in the lower x-scale; ϕb is equivalent to porosity of an unfractured plug.
