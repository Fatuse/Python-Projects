The importance of having a correct value of the porosity exponent m in petrophysical interpretation of NFRs is never over-emphasized. 
That can easily make the difference between abandoning or completing a successful well as proved dramatically in many places around the world. 
There is a tendency in many quarters to assume a constant value of m (a typical case is the assumption m = 2). 
This might be a reasonable assumption in the case of some conventional interparticle single-porosity reservoirs; but it is generally a poor 
assumption in NFRs. In the case of NFRs represented by dual porosity models there are three different values of the porosity exponent: mb of the matrix 
block, mf of the natural fractures and m of the composite system of matrix and fractures. For dual porosity models made out of matrix 
and fractures: mb > m > mf.

In general, as porosity of the composite system gets smaller, the value of m also gets smaller. This is illustrated in the graph 
with data of carbonates from 14 Abu Dhabi fields covering an area of approximately 10,000 km2 (Borai, 1987).
