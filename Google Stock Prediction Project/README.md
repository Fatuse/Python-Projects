This is a Project showing the Application of Recurrent Neural Networks to stock prediction in tensorflow
A difficult sort of predictive modelling challenge is time series prediction. Unlike regression predictive modelling, 
time series modelling includes a sequence dependence among the input variables, which adds to the complexity.
Recurrent neural networks are a powerful type of neural network that can handle sequence dependence. 
Because very large architectures may be effectively taught, the Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM network, is a type of 
recurrent neural network used in deep learning.

Recurrent neural networks with basic LSTM cells were implemented.
